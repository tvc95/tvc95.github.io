Hello! My name is Thiago Viana de Carvalho and this is my first blog, where I'll be sharing some thoughts and experiences I've had with programming and software development in general (despite most of my experience during my time at the university was with games), and other related stuff. Don't expect this blog to be updated frequently, but I'll try to bring some relevant content with some frequency. I don't really have the intention to make this blog "stand out", I just thought of using this space to share something that I hope it can be of some use for some people (especially those that are starting in the area). In case you want to know more about me, check my home page and some of the projects I've worked on during my undergraduate and graduate studies.







<!-- ## How to Use This Theme
Just go ahead and read up on [how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not too hard I promise!

Download this repository [here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively) and save it to any folder you want.

Open a terminal window or a command line and ```cd``` to that location.

Then enter: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```. You can now access your new Jekyll site from [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Have fun exploring your new site!
