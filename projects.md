## [2019] Caixa de Pandora - VR edition (in development)

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/sscaixarv.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The development of this VR prototype was part of my master's thesis, where this new approach of the educational serious game Caixa de Pandora ("Pandora's Box" in English) was developed by using 360º scenarios (videos and images). The original approach was developed by the Laboratory of Technologies for Virtual Teaching and Statistics (LabTEVE) at Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), and consists of an educational quiz game that aims to address the issue of violence against women (VAW), not only by transmitting the concepts related to VAW, but also attempts to make the players reflect about their own personal conceptions in face of this problem.

This prototype was developed by using Unity (v. 2019.1.1f1) with Google VR SDK for Unity, and is still in development. However, the original version is already available for Android systems at Google Play Store, and you can find out more [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.ufpb.labteve.caixapandora&hl=pt_BR).

## [2019] Recruta Social

<a href="https://youtu.be/7Aq0b_pwDIg" class="image left" style="overflow:visible"><img src="{{ "/images/ssrecrutasocial.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>

Recruta Social ("Social Recruit" in English) was the result of a collaboration between the Tribunal de Contas do Estado da Paraíba (TCE-PB) and the Laboratory of Digital Video Applications (LAVID-UFPB) and it consists of an adventure serious game that aims to teach the role of the State Court of Auditors in the citizens' lives, in addition to encourage the practice of social control by the players. The main focus of its gameplay is to accomplish missions by solving problems faced by the citizens, caused by poor public management and the irregular use of public resources. For that, the player must explore the environment and interact with the citizens and key items hidden in the stage. In this project, I've worked at the early stages of development and prototyping, focusing mostly on the implementation of gameplay mechanics and UI.

This game was developed with the Unity engine and it's already available for Android smartphones (v. 4.4 or newer) at Google Play Store. This game was also finalist in three categories during the SBGames 2019 Games Festival at Rio de Janeiro: "Best Student Game", "Best Serious Game" and "Best Mobile Game".

## [2017] Desafio Solar / Eletrogame

<a href="https://youtu.be/lFt-2_nSeSg" class="image left" style="overflow:visible"><img src="{{ "/images/ssdesafio.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>

With the objective of introducing concepts of converting solar energy into electricity to high school students from public schools, as well as concepts related to electrical installations, this joint effort between the Center of Alternative and Renewable Energies (CEAR-UFPB) and the State Secretariat of Education of Paraíba (SEE-PB) resulted in the development of two serious games aiming to encourage student learning in a more practical and playful way. Both games were developed with the Unity engine for Android tablets given by the government. In this project, I worked on the implementation of basic gameplay mechanics, UI interaction and code/game optimization.

"Desafio Solar" ("Solar Challenge" in English) focused on the teaching of photovoltaic systems by providing an environment where the students could experiment and learn with a virtual photovoltaic system, without any risk of handling and damage to a physical photovoltaic system. Through the game, the student deals with basic concepts about the components of the solar energy system interactively, assimilating them before the physical kit is presented in the classroom. The other game developed, "Eletrogame", was focused on the teaching of electrical installations and it was conceived with the same basis as "Desafio Solar". Both games were released in 2017 to students of public schools of the state of Paraíba, Brazil.

## [2017] S.A.I.L (Stream Audio Interpreter for Ludicity)

<a href="https://youtu.be/EoN2Vm4uGJM" class="image left" style="overflow:visible"><img src="{{ "/images/sssail.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>

S.A.I.L (a.k.a "Stream Audio Interpreter for Ludicity") is a PC game developed with Unity during the Global Game Jam 2017, combining retro visuals, music, meteors and survival. Sailing in the seas, you must survive at all costs by preventing the boat to sink by the waves and avoid total destruction from falling meteors. Choose any music file to play the game! The ocean waves are influenced by the music you choose! (Just .ogg and .wav audio files are supported. If you have any other audio file, you must convert it to .ogg and .wav). In this project, I focused mostly on game design and helped with the implementation. The game is available to download and play, and if you'd like to check out some other games I've participated in the development at other GGJ events, you can find them [at my GGJ profile](https://globalgamejam.org/users/velvetrage).

## [2015] Devastitans

<a href="https://youtu.be/fNfCZitzqCA" class="image left" style="overflow:visible"><img src="{{ "/images/ssdevas.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>

Devastitans was a 2D fighting game implemented using Unity as a project for the course of game development at Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). It is basically a 2D fighting game with customizable robots and skills. Select robot parts, skills and status through a skill tree and build the best strategy to win. In this project, I worked mostly as lead game designer and project manager.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information. -->
