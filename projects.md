## [2019] Caixa de Pandora - VR edition (in development)

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/sscaixarv.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The development of this prototype was part of my master's thesis. A VR approach of the educational serious game Caixa de Pandora ("Pandora's Box" in English) was developed by using 360º scenarios (videos and images). The original approach was developed by the Laboratory of Technologies for Virtual Teaching and Statistics (LabTEVE) at Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), and consists of an educational quiz game that aims to address the issue of violence against women (VAW), not only by transmitting the concepts related to VAW, but also attempts to make the players reflect about their own personal conceptions in face of this problem.

This prototype was develped by using Unity (v. 2019.1.1f1) with Google VR SDK for Unity, and is still in development. However, the original version is already available for Android systems at Google Play Store, and you can find out more [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.ufpb.labteve.caixapandora&hl=pt_BR).

## [2019] Recruta Social

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/ssrecrutasocial.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Recruta Social ("Social Recruit" in English) was the result of a collaboration between the Tribunal de Contas do Estado da Paraíba (TCE-PB) and the Laboratory of Digital Video Applications (LAVID-UFPB) and it consists of an adventure serious game that aims to teach the role of the State Court of Auditors in the citizens' lives, in addition to encourage the practice of social control by the players. The main focus of its gameplay is to accomplish missions by solving problems faced by the citizens, caused by poor public management and the irregular use of public resources. For that, the player must explore the environment and interact with the citizens and key items hidden in the stage.

This game was developed with the Unity engine and it's already available for Android smartphones (v. 4.4 or newer) at Google Play Store. This game was also finalist in three categories during the SBGames 2019 Games Festival at Rio de Janeiro: "Best Student Game", "Best Serious Game" and "Best Mobile Game".

<span href="https://youtu.be/EoN2Vm4uGJM" class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/sssail.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

S.A.I.L (a.k.a "Stream Audio Interpreter for Ludicity") is a PC game developed with Unity during the Global Game Jam 2017, combining retro visuals, music, meteors and survival. Sailing in the seas, you must survive at all costs by preventing the boat to sink by the waves and avoid total destruction from falling meteors. Choose any music file to play the game! The ocean waves are influenced by the music you choose! (Just .ogg and .wav audio files are supported. If you have any other audio file, you must convert it to .ogg and .wav). You can download and play it, as well as check out some other games developed at other GGJ events [at my profile](https://globalgamejam.org/users/velvetrage).

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
